The project was my first ever HTML project. 
It was a task given by Start.ng pre-internship program.
It's a simple HTML only implementation of my CV with an image, the image is from cloudinary just by calling the link.
This project has exposed me a lot on devs tools and web biginners tutorials.

I updated my CV page with CSS, it was fun building building a page with CSS.
CSS actually added more beauty the the page through the colors, margins, borders, sizes, etc
